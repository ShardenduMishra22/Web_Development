Welcome to My Web Development Journey!
I embarked on a journey to learn web development and discovered an excellent course by Angela Yu on Udemy. I invested in it, studied diligently, and now, this repository houses all the code, learning notes, and projects I've worked on throughout the course.

Feel free to explore and enjoy!
